This Solidity code defines a simple token contract called MyToken. Here's a breakdown of each part of the code:

// SPDX License Identifier and Solidity Version
solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

- *SPDX License Identifier*: This specifies the license under which the contract is released, in this case, the MIT License.
- *pragma solidity ^0.8.26*: This specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used. The ^ symbol indicates that any version of Solidity from 0.8.26 and above (but below 0.9.0) can compile this code.

//Contract Definition
solidity
contract MyToken {

This line begins the definition of the MyToken contract.

//Public Variables
solidity
string public myTokenName = "BHaviya Saini";
string public myTokenAbbr = "saini";
uint public totalSupply = 0;

- myTokenName: A public variable that stores the name of the token, set to "BHaviya Saini".
- myTokenAbbr: A public variable that stores the abbreviation of the token, set to "saini".
- totalSupply: A public variable that keeps track of the total supply of the token, initialized to 0.

// Mapping of Addresses to Balances
solidity
mapping (address => uint) public balance;

- This creates a mapping from addresses to their respective token balances. The balance mapping allows the contract to store and retrieve the balance of each address.

// Mint Function
solidity
function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
    totalSupply += _value;
    balance[_address] += _value;
}

- *Purpose*: This function allows new tokens to be created and assigned to a specific address.
- *Parameters*:
  - _address: The address to which the newly minted tokens will be assigned.
  - _value: The number of tokens to mint.
- *Functionality*: 
  - Increases the totalSupply by _value.
  - Increases the balance of _address by _value.

// Burn Function
solidity
function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
    if (balance[_address] >= _value) {
        totalSupply -= _value;
        balance[_address] -= _value;
    }
}

Purpose: This function allows tokens to be destroyed (burned) and removed from a specific address.
Parameters:
_address: The address from which tokens will be burned.
_value: The number of tokens to burn.
Functionality:
Checks if the balance of _address is greater than or equal to _value. This ensures that an address cannot burn more tokens than it owns.
If the condition is met, it decreases the totalSupply by _value.
Decreases the balance of _address by _value.
Summary
The MyToken contract defines a basic token with functionalities to mint and burn tokens. It maintains the token's name, abbreviation, and total supply, as well as a mapping of addresses to their token balances. The mint function increases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, while the burn function decreases the total supply and the balance of a specified address, provided that the address has enough tokens to burn.
